				<h1>The Self Driving Car</h1>
				<p class="content-pro">The Self Driving Car project is an AI and Deep Learning based project which aims
					at the
					automation of cars which implies the cars learn to drive by analysing the user and it will then
					drive on its
					own without any intervention.</p>

				<h1>Connect 4</h1>
				<p class="content-pro">Connect-4_expert is an artificially intelligent system based on the connect 4
					board game.
					It can be played as single player with the AI as well as multiplayer. The AI uses mini-max algorithm
					with
					alpha-beta pruning to predict moves. The game can be played from anywhere, as it uses socket
					programming for
					connecting the human player(client) and the AI(server) </p>

					AI and
					Image processing to detect and track human faces and has the ability to recognize human speech and
					act upon
					it. A Raspberry Pi controls various servos and other motors via an Arduino UNO for actuating
					gestures such as
					performing handshake and neck movements.</p>

					printed body
					and is made of two pieces connected by a spine which is a novel approach for a quadruped as all
					current
					quadrupeds have a single piece body. It is capable of following a person and going to designated
					places using
					a camera connected to a raspberry pi. It uses servos as actuators to make it walk and move its head
					as
					required.</p>

					write with a
					pen. It not only writes any sort of document but also can sketch according to the Gcode given. The
					mechanism
					was set and carried out with the electrical components which includes Arduino and CNC shield. Later,
					the Gcode
					was generated with the help of benbox and was processed on the system for output.</p>

				<h1>Robotic Arm</h1>
				<p class="content-pro">The arm uses a colour sensor to differentiate between objects marked with a
					specific
					colour and performs the task of separating them based upon their markers. The arm was made using
					servos
					mounted on a metal chassis and is controlled by Arduino uno for performing the task of separating
					them. The
					arm has a colour sensor module placed at its tip to identify the different colours and is connected
					to the
					Arduino which reads the data and performs desired tasks.</p>

				<h1>VR Based Bot</h1>
				<p class="content-pro">A bot that is not only capable of going into remote areas but also recreate
					whatever it
					is seeing as a virtual environment around you. The camera present in the bot takes photos and sends
					them to a
					mobile phone using a raspberry pi where a virtual reality environment is made. All you need is a vr
					headset.
					This bot finds applications in many areas such as disaster management or even in military where the
					bot can be
					sent ahead for recon of an area.</p>

				<h1>Smart Door Lock</h1>
				<p class="content-pro">With billions being spent on security systems every year we came up with a
					solution that
					requires a username and password like any other basic security system. In addition to that locking
					mechanism
					needs your biometric data and a face scan to ensure only authorised personnel enter. It is a
					cost-effective
					method and can be installed in office buildings. Since the whole processing is done in a raspberry
					pi locally,
					it greatly reduces the latency and improves the accuracy of the system.</p>

					calculations and
					image processing, it is able to recreate an accurate 3D model of its surroundings. This capability
					of the
					drone makes it a very useful took for surveying or finding out the layout of an indoor area.</p>
